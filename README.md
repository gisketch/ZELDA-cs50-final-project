# 🧝 Zelda: A GPT-3 Powered Natural Language Mathematical Expression Parser

Zelda is a natural language mathematical expression parser powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The application is built in JavaScript and ReactJS.

#### Video Demo: <WIP>

#### Description:

##### ✨ Features

Zelda can:

- Explain primary school mathematical word problems by converting and parsing them into mathematical expressions.
- Show the step by step process.
- Zelda is not accurate at solving mathematics, so she will never answer the equations. Only show how the operations were parsed from the word problem.

##### 🛠️ Installation

To install and run Zelda, you will need:

- Node.js and npm installed on your Raspberry Pi.
- An OpenAI API key for GPT-3.
- A microphone and a speaker

To install Zelda, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gisketch/ZELDA-math-parser`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ZELDA-math-parser`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (create a .env file): `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR KEY HERE`
5. Start the application: `npm run dev`

##### 🚀 Usage

1. Enter your name so that Zelda will know who she's talking to! 👋
